Recent advances in foundation models like SAM2 have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation. However, directly applying SAM2 to Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) is limited by challenges in identity management and memory efficiency.

Seg2Track-SAM2 addresses these challenges by:
- Integrating pre-trained object detectors with SAM2
- Introducing a novel Seg2Track module for track initialization, management, and reinforcement
- Remaining detector-agnostic and requiring no fine-tuning

## Installation

SAM 2 needs to be installed first before use. The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.5.1` and `torchvision>=0.20.1`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. You can install SAM 2 on a GPU machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git && cd sam2

pip install -e .
```
If you are installing on Windows, it's strongly recommended to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with Ubuntu.

To use the SAM 2 predictor and run the example notebooks, `jupyter` and `matplotlib` are required and can be installed by:

```bash
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

Note:
1. It's recommended to create a new Python environment via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for this installation and install PyTorch 2.5.1 (or higher) via `pip` following https://pytorch.org/. If you have a PyTorch version lower than 2.5.1 in your current environment, the installation command above will try to upgrade it to the latest PyTorch version using `pip`.
2. The step above requires compiling a custom CUDA kernel with the `nvcc` compiler. If it isn't already available on your machine, please install the [CUDA toolkits](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) with a version that matches your PyTorch CUDA version.
3. If you see a message like `Failed to build the SAM 2 CUDA extension` during installation, you can ignore it and still use SAM 2 (some post-processing functionality may be limited, but it doesn't affect the results in most cases).


### Execution

This model is ready to run KITTI and MOT datasets with the kitti_run and mot_run scripts, respectively. In order to run said scripts, it is necessary to supply a configuration file with the flag --config (check configs folder for some examples).

Detections must be supplied on the config file. This must follow the format defined for TrackRCNN detections (supplied in KITTI) or MOT detectors.

### Download Checkpoints

All the model checkpoints can be downloaded by running:

```bash
cd checkpoints && \
./download_ckpts.sh && \
cd ..
```
